<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Cassidy Jensen. I am starting my senior year as a TAM major at CU Boulder and I work three different jobs at the school. My favorite job is as a student assistant for the space grant's mission to the moon: GLEE!
</p>
<h2>History with Web Technology</h2>
<p>After taking Web as a TAM student, I have begun to focus in the subject of web development. Since then, I have worked as a Student Assistant Web Developer for CU Research and Support Office. I took Front End Development during my last semester and am currently taking Creative Web Development. It has become a partial focus for me as a student and I am interested in the potential applications outside of school. I have even researched a how to be a free lance web developer. A web project I have considered doing, but have not started, is creating an immersive web comic with one of my friends. It is still in the early brainstorming phase. 
</p>
<h2>Interested in Learning</h2>
<p> I am interested in learning a lot of the topics this class has previously covered. I am excited by the prospect of VR and AR using Aframe. Additionally, for my potential webcomic I believe Parallax Scrolling is a good skill that could be applied to a variety of things. Finally, I thought the work with sprite sheets and animating sounded really interesting. If it is possible to find a new method for doing it, that would be fantastic.
